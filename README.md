🛍 Customer Segmentation on Walmart Transactions

Using K-Means + RFM + PCA for Behavioral Insights

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart customer transaction data to identify consumer segments using machine learning clustering techniques. By leveraging RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features and K-Means clustering, we classify customers into distinct segments to support targeted marketing, loyalty improvement, and personalized recommendation strategies.
